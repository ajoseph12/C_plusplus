- Files must be saved with .cpp extension
- The complier
    - **Checks code** and verifies if code follows c++ **rules**
    - Translates c++ code to machine language called **object file** with the extension .o or .obj. So each .cpp file will have its respective object file created during compilation.
- The linker
    - Takes object files generated by compiler and combines them into a single executable program.
    - It is also capable of linking library files - a collection of pre-complied code that has been packaged up.
    - Makes sure that all cross-file dependencies are resolved properly. If you define something in one .cpp file, and then use it in another .cpp file, the linker connects the two together. If the linker is unable to connect a reference to something with its definition, youâ€™ll get a **linker error**, and the linking process will abort.
